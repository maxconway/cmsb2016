Calibrating parameters is a crucial problem within quantitative
modeling approaches to reaction networks. Existing methods for
stochastic models rely either on statistical sampling or can only be
applied to small systems. Here we present an inference procedure for
stochastic models in equilibrium that is based on a moment matching
scheme with optimal weighting and that can be used with high-throughput data 
like the one collected by flow cytometry. 
Our method does not require an approximation of the underlying equilibrium
  probability distribution and, if reaction rate constants have to be learned,
  the optimal values can be computed by solving a linear system of
  equations.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on 
  three case studies.
