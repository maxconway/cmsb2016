Steady-state computation is an important aspect of analysing biological systems modelled as Probabilistic Boolean networks (PBNs). Efficient statistical methods are required for computing steady-state probabilities for large PBNs. We focus on parallel the simulation process using graphics process unit (GPU)-based techniques to accelerate the steady-state computation process for large PBNs. We discuss two specially treated issues when applying GPU-based techniques. Experimental results show that a speedup of more than two orders of magnitude can be reached with our method.
