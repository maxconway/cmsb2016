\textsc{Pint} implements static analyses for computing dynamical properties on very large-scale Automata Networks, ranging from hundreds to several thousands of concurrently interacting components. Provided analyses include notably the listing of fixed points, the analysis successive reachability properties, the inference of cut sets for reachability, and model reduction preserving transient dynamics. The translation to related formalisms, in particular Boolean and multi-valued networks or Petri nets, is also provided, as well as interfaces with model-checking tools, such as NuSMV or Mole.
