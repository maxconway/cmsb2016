The BioModelAnalyzer (BMA) is a web based tool for the development of discrete models of biological systems. Through a graphical user interface, it allows rapid development of complex models of gene and protein interaction networks and stability analysis without requiring users to be proficient computer programmers. Here I will present a new set of tools in the BMA that allow users to perform complex queries over models in linear temporal logic, allowing biologists to test specifications based on the dynamics observed in simulations. In keeping with the core objective of tool, queries are constructed graphically and results are presented to the users with examples of simulations. Alongside stability analysis, this new tool allows biologists to verify complex specifications to validate executable biological models.
