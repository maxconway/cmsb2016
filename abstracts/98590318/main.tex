The interaction of proteins and peptides with inorganic surfaces is relevant in a wide array of technological applications, yet it is difficult to characterize these interactions with high resolution experimentally. For this purpose we have developed a computational protocol for efficient in silico evaluation of the binding affinity of peptides for different inorganic surfaces. With EISM we are able to reproduce and predict experimental results for Au(111) binding peptides. EISM in future can propose peptides sequences functionalizing the surfaces in a desired way.
