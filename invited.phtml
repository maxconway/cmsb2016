          <h4 class="centered"><strong>Title:</strong> Morphisms of reaction networks</h4>
           <p class="collapse just" id="invited1"><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
The mechanisms underlying complex biological systems are routinely represented as networks, and their kinetics is widely studied. It turns out that relationships between network structures can reveal similarity of mechanism.
We define morphisms (mappings) between reaction networks that establish structural connections between them. Some morphisms imply kinetic similarity, and yet their properties can be checked statically on the structure of the networks. In particular we can determine statically that a complex network will emulate a simpler network: it will reproduce its kinetics for all corresponding choices of reaction rates and initial conditions. We use this property to relate the kinetics of many common biological networks of different sizes, also relating them to a fundamental population algorithm. Thus, structural similarity between reaction networks can be revealed by network morphisms, elucidating mechanistic and functional aspects of complex networks in terms of simpler networks
In recent joint work, we established a correspondence between network emulation and a notion of backward bisimulation for continuous systems. An emulation morphism establishes a bisimulation relation over the union of two networks, and a bisimulation relation over a network can be seen as an emulation morphism from the full network to the reduced network of its equivalence classes. Along this correspondence, we obtain minimization algorithms for chemical reaction networks, which are of interest for model execution, and algorithms to discover morphisms between networks, which are of interest for model understanding.

          <h4 class="centered"><strong>Title:</strong> (Mathematical) Logic for Systems Biology</h4>
           <p class="collapse just" id="invited2"><strong>Abstract:</strong> We advocate here the use of (mathematical) logic for systems biology, as a unified framework well suited for both modeling the dynamic behaviour of biological systems, expressing properties of them, and verifying these properties.
The potential candidate logics should have a traditional proof theoretic pedigree (including a sequent calculus presentation enjoying cut-elimination and focusing), and should come with (certified) proof tools. Beyond providing a reliable framework, this allows the adequate encodings of our biological systems.
We shall present two candidate logics (two modal extensions of linear logic, called HyLL and SELL), along with biological examples. The examples we have considered so far are very simple ones - coming with completely formal (interactive) proofs in Coq.
Future works includes using automatic provers, which would extend existing automatic provers for linear logic. This should enable us to specify and study more realistic examples in systems biology, biomedicine (diagnosis and prognosis), and eventually neuroscience.
This talk is based on joint works with Kaustuv Chaudhuri (INRIA Saclay), Amy Felty (Univ. of Ottawa), Pietro Lio (Cambridge Univ.), and Carlos Olarte and Elaine Pimentel (Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil).</p>

Joëlle Despeyroux is a researcher at INRIA-Sophia-Antipolis.
She first worked in the semantics of programming languages area, proposing a pure logical view of Gordon Plotkin's Structural Operational Semantics (called "Natural Semantics"), well suited, for example, for proofs of correctness of compilers. She then worked in (mathematical) logic, at several levels: design of new type theories (unifying CCind and LF), proofs on the computer (mainly in Coq), and design and development of (a prototype of) a proof assistant (called "Theo"). 
More recently, in joint work with Kaustuv Chaudhuri at INRIA-Saclay, she proposed a new (modal linear) logic as a Logical Framework for both specifying and analysing models of biological systems, viewed as transition systems. She is now working in this area, with several co-workers from Cambridge, Ottawa, and Brazil, using this new framework in various areas, from molecular biology to biomedicine. 
Joëlle Despeyroux has a PhD in Mathematics from Paris University. She worked at INRIA-Roquencourt before moving to INRIA-Sophia-Antipolis.</p>

           <p class="collapse just" id="invited3"><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
           In this talk I will present our journey during the past few years within the very exciting area of neural networks. I will first start with artificial neurones and neural networks and explain why we got interested in such networks. I will then turn to the mathematical modelling of biological neurones and neural networks. We will distinguish between non-spiking neurones, such as the ones found in C. Elegans, and spiking neurones, as found in most of the other larger organisms. We will discuss our work in analysing the behaviour of such networks, the use in control, and the challenges and opportunities in this area.</p>

Embedding machine learning in formal stochastic models of biological processes</h4>
           <p class="collapse just" id="invited4"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Formal modelling languages such as process algebras are effective tools in computational
biological modelling.  However, handling data and uncertainty in these representations in
a statistically meaningful way is an open problem, severely hampering the usefulness of
these elegant tools in many real biological applications.
I will present ProPPA, a process algebra which incorporates uncertainty in the model
description, supporting the use of Machine Learning techniques to integrate observational
data in the modelling.  I will explain how this is given a semantics in terms of a
generalisation of Constraint Markov Chains, and demonstrate how this can be used
to perform inference over biological models.</p>
